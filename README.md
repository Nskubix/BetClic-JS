I am creating/created a betting website inspiration to BetClic ofcourse i dont collect any money from this and you cannot bet real money its only a for fun project
I coded everything myself 

Scraping from "https://onefootball.com/en/competition/premier-league-9/fixtures"
To update fixtures.csv run main.py. It works as long as onefootball doesnt change anything and the premier league is not ended yet. Also you can specify how many matches it should write to the csv file so when its the end of the season consider changing that ammount default is 30
