I am creating/created a betting website inspired by BetClic of course I don't collect any money from this and you cannot bet real money it's only a fun project
I coded everything myself 

Scraping from "https://onefootball.com/en/competition/premier-league-9/fixtures"
To update fixtures.csv run main.py. It works as long as onefootball doesn't change anything and the premier league is not ended yet. Also, you can specify how many matches it should write to the CSV file so when it is the end of the season consider changing that amount default is 30
